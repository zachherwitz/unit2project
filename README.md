<!-- USER STORIES -->

<!-- TECHNOLOGY USED -->
- html | css | js | jQuery | mongoDB | mongoose | Node.js | express | ejs | photoshop | adobe xd

<!-- NEXT STEPS -->
- Necessitates secure authentication, and multiple models with relationships
- Distro model that would allow the user to customize icon images, colors, fonts, etc.
- More coherent theme and color-scheme
- A lot more could be turned into partials

<!-- STRUGGLES -->
- Unsure of where to place certain pieces of code - the controller, the ejs file, or a required .js file?
- Reading the documentation really did not work - something just didn't click so I shelved it and focused on what I knew worked
