#### dISTRIBUTION can be difficult.
Do you and your boss have a different idea of what 'send it wide' means?  

Are you tired of accidentally sending nudity riders to day-playing grips?  

Does HR want you to add YET ANOTHER INTERN to the monthly pizza party chain?

With d|STRO, creating and managing distribution lists is simple, visual, and secure.

TECHNOLOGY USED
- html | css | js | jQuery | mongoDB | mongoose | Node.js | express | ejs | photoshop | adobe xd

NEXT STEPS
- Necessitates secure authentication, and multiple models with relationships
- Distro model that would allow the user to customize icon images, colors, fonts, etc.
- More coherent theme and color-scheme
- A LOT more could be turned into partials

STRUGGLES
- Unsure of where to place certain pieces of code - the controller, the ejs file, or a required .js file?
